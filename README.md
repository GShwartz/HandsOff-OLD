# HandsOff
![logo](https://github.com/GShwartz/HandsOff/raw/main/Images/HandsOff_resized.png) <br />
### A small and free <i>Client</i> <-> <i>Server</i> solution for IT & HD specialists.  <br />

### The Idea
Do you love your job but hate the customer's <b>technophobic</b> nature and unwillingness to cooperate? <br />
<b>ME TOO!</b> <br /><br /> 
This is where <b>HandsOff</b> comes in. <br />
The entire idea behind this solution is that the other side only holds the <b>phone</b> and nothing else<br />
** Maintenance & Update options are unavailable ATM.
